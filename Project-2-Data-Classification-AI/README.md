# Data Classification Using AI

## DecodeLabs Artificial Intelligence Internship - Project 2

### Project Overview

This project is part of the DecodeLabs Artificial Intelligence Internship.

The goal of this project is to build a basic classification model using a small dataset. The project demonstrates the basic supervised learning process, including loading and understanding data, splitting data into training and testing sets, training a classification model, and making predictions.

The project follows the main requirements provided for Project 2: loading and understanding a dataset, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and applying a simple classification algorithm.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

* Load and understand a dataset.
* Prepare data for machine learning.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Apply a simple classification algorithm.
* Train a machine learning model.
* Test the model and measure its accuracy.
* Make a prediction using new data.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Iris dataset**, which contains measurements of iris flowers.

The dataset contains:

* **150 samples**
* **4 features**
* **3 classes**

### Features

* Sepal length
* Sepal width
* Petal length
* Petal width

### Classes

* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Algorithm

A **Decision Tree Classifier** is used for classification.

The model learns patterns from the training data and uses those patterns to classify the testing data and new input data.

## Training and Testing

The dataset is divided into:

* **80% training data** - 120 samples
* **20% testing data** - 30 samples

The training data is used to train the Decision Tree model, while the testing data is used to evaluate its performance.

## Results

The model was trained successfully and tested using the testing dataset.

### Model Accuracy

**100.00%**

### New Prediction

A new flower measurement was provided to the trained model.

The predicted class was:

**Setosa**

## How to Run

### 1. Open the Project 2 folder

Open the following folder in Visual Studio Code:
