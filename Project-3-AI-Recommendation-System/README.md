# AI Movie Recommendation System

## DecodeLabs Artificial Intelligence Internship - Project 3

An AI-based movie recommendation system that recommends movies based on the user's preferred genres. The system uses preference matching and similarity logic to identify movies that best match the user's interests.

---

## Project Overview

The AI Movie Recommendation System allows users to enter one or more movie genres they are interested in.

The system:

* Accepts multiple user preferences
* Compares user preferences with movie genres
* Calculates a match score
* Identifies matching genres
* Ranks movies based on their matching score
* Displays movie recommendations

The recommendation process uses simple and explainable similarity logic.

---

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how an AI-based recommendation system can use user preferences and similarity logic to provide personalized movie recommendations.

---

## Recommendation Logic

The system compares the genres selected by the user with the genres assigned to each movie.

The match score is calculated using:

**Match Score = (Matched Preferences / Total User Preferences) x 100**

For example, if the user selects:


Action, Sci-Fi


and a movie contains:

Action, Sci-Fi, Adventure


the movie receives:


Match Score: 100%


If a movie contains only `Action`, it receives:


Match Score: 50%


Movies are then ranked according to their matching scores.

## Available Genres

The system currently supports:

* Action
* Adventure
* Comedy
* Crime
* Drama
* Animation
* Family
* Sci-Fi
* Thriller

---

## Movie Dataset

The project uses a predefined movie dataset containing movies and their associated genres.

Example movies include:

* Inception
* Interstellar
* The Matrix
* The Dark Knight
* Avengers: Endgame
* Jurassic Park
* Toy Story

---

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Python Standard Library
* Preference Matching
* Similarity Logic
* Rule-Based Recommendation

No external Python libraries are required for the current version.
